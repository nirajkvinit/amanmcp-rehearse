## Layered Documentation

Each major concept has three levels of detail:

| Level | Time | Content | Audience |
|-------|------|---------|----------|
| **Overview** | 3-4 min | What it is, why it matters | Everyone |
| **How It Works** | 8-10 min | Examples, intuition, no formulas | Users wanting to understand |
| **Advanced** | 15+ min | Algorithms, code, implementation | Developers extending the system |
